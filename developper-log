=head1 Version 0.14, november 2016

=head2 Why

Since its beginning, F<DT::C::FR> has used F<Params::Validate>,
juste like the older versions of L<DateTime> did.

But L<DateTime> has switched to L<specio> since version 1.37.
The problem is, when I try to install L<Specio> on my computer, I have errors
involving L<B::Generate::Hook::EndOfScope> or something like that.
I have tried with several versions under C<perlbrew> 
and on a few virtual machines, but it always fails.

So, to test version 0.13, I decided to use an older version of
L<DateTime> before the switch to L<Specio>.

Problem is, I check my module in several environments I<with> L<Params::Validate>,
so I did not see that this module should be mentionned in the prerequisites.

Version 0.14 was about adding L<Params::Validate> as a prerequisite. How could I 
check that my fix was good? How could I check that I would get an error when
building my module in an environment without L<Params::Validate>?

=head2 Preparation

I use a virtual machine with VirtualBox. I always install
L<Module::Version> on each virtual machine I create.
For this case, I also install the prerequisites for L<DateTime>
(install with C<cpan>, not C<make> or C<Build>).

=head3 Prerequisites for L<DateTime> 1.36

According to L<metacpan.org>:

  base
  Carp
  constant
  DateTime::Locale
  DateTime::TimeZone
  Dist::CheckConflicts
  integer
  namespace::autoclean
  overload
  Params::Validate
  POSIX
  Scalar::Util
  strict
  Try::Tiny
  warnings
  warnings::register
  XSLoader

=head3 Prerequisites for L<DateTime::TimeZone> 2.01

According to L<metacpan.org>:

  Class::Singleton
  constant
  Cwd
  File::Basename
  File::Compare
  File::Find
  File::Spec
  List::Util
  Module::Runtime
  Params::Validate
  parent
  strict
  Try::Tiny
  vars
  warnings

and possibly others

=head3 Prerequisites for L<DateTime::Locale> 1.05

According to L<metacpan.org>:

  Carp
  Dist::CheckConflicts
  Exporter
  List::Util
  Params::Validate
  strict
  warnings

=head3 Modules that need to be installed

Most of the prerequisites above are core modules. Non-core modules are often related to each other
as prerequisites.  So using C<cpan>, I had only to install a few modules. I think these modules are
L<Dist::CheckConflicts>, L<Module::Runtime> and possibly L<Try::Tiny>.

Post-scriptum: also, I should have installed L<Test::Warnings>, L<namespace::autoclean>, L<CPAN::Meta::Check>
and a newer version of L<List::Util>. I installed them during the second step (see below).

I did not install L<Params::Validate>, L<DateTime::TimeZone> and L<DateTime::Locale>
on purpose.

=head2 Testing version 0.14

=head3 First step

Without L<Params::Validate>, L<DateTime>, L<DateTime::TimeZone> and L<DateTime::Locale>,
untar F<DateTime-Calendar-FrenchRevolutionary.tar.gz>.

Run F<Makefile.PL> and F<Build.PL>. If it stops, claiming that L<Params::Validate> is missing,
the test is conclusive. If it stops because of another prerequisite, the test is successful,
but not conclusive.

Post-scriptum: the test was conclusive, it mentioned L<DateTime>, L<Roman> and L<Params::Validate>.

=head3 Second Step

Install L<Params::Validate> with C<cpan>.

Install L<DateTime::Locale>, L<DateTime::TimeZone> and L<DateTime>.
Manual installation with:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

Within the F<DateTime-Calendar-FrenchRevolutionary> directory, run

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test

and

  perl Build.PL
  ./Build
  ./Build test

There should be no errors.

=head3 Third Step

Rename the F<lib/Params/Validate.pm> file to another name.
So L<DateTime> is still installed, even if it is unusable.
Within the F<DateTime-Calendar-FrenchRevolutionary> directory, run

  perl Makefile.PL

and

  perl Build.PL

It should fail because of L<Params::Validate>.

=head2 To do

Find why L<Specio> fails on my computer.
